V01.01.00:
SaveLoadSystem:
+ Delete(); for SaveLoadSystem, this will remove the current selected save File.

SaveableEntity:
+ Feature to determine if an object has @Awake a already existing ID -> then the ID will be regenerated.
  This is the case, if you copy an instantiated object.

~ Some bugfixes in the Editor Tools


V01.02.00:
+ Saving of the transform data of the Object will be optional now and can be deactivated.
