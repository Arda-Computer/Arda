## About

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
    
    
  <div id="leftThing" style="float: left; width:50%;">
	  
Conventional personal computing hasn't changed for the past half a century. We're on a mission to make humans and computers more productive, starting with making the web more accessible to those unable to use conventional PCs.

Being productive on the web in AR with todays tooling is painful. AR personal computing has gone mostly ignored by big tech as they‚Äôve focused on gaming and miscellaneous industrial niches. 
      
We believe augmented reality (AR) is a core enabling technology, bringing the utility of a workstation, portability of a laptop and the potential for (killer) applications to be useful in ways we never thought possible.
	 
Join us and contribute to building the future.

<h1></h1>


Moving away from a form-factor that is as deeply entrenched as conventional personal computing - having not changed in the past half a century - is no easy feat. We‚Äôre therefore taking a staged approach to building this future:

`Milestone 1:` Reaching feature parity with conventional personal computers. Luckily, since most of what we do today is in the browser, we can build a tool on top of this preexisting, open and powerful ecosystem.

`Milestone 2:` Become more usable, convenient and faster to use than conventional personal computers. Using XR-native features like eye tracking, higher i/o bandwidth and multiplayer to take the product from hobbyists to mass market. 

`Milestone 3:`  Build a platform based on WebXR, allowing developers to build new types of applications.


## Contributing
We are always looking for contributors of all skill levels! If you're looking to ease your way into the project, try out a good first issue.


Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.


Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.


## Getting started

Arda's backend is currently using a web browser made by [Vuplex](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/40309) which is in turn built ontop of GeckoView. This asset is paid, and required for Arda to work. It may be possible to strip out the web browser from Arda so it can run without this asset.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Arda-Computer/Arda
   ```
2. Open Arda using Unity 2021 LTS
   - Set the platform to Android in Unity Hub before you open the project for the first time so you do not have to import assets twice
3. Add [3D WebView for Android with Gecko Engine (Web Browser)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-android-with-gecko-engine-web-browser-158778) to the project
4. (optional) Add [3D WebView for Windows and macOS (Web Browser)](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/3d-webview-for-windows-and-macos-web-browser-154144) to the project
    - This step is only necessary if you want the UI to work in the editor
5. Connect an Oculus headset to the computer, activate Oculus Link, then press play in Unity
    - If you stay in your Oculus home after pressing play in Unity, try restarting Unity while keeping Oculus link connected, then press play again
6. To build, go to build and build to wanted platform
